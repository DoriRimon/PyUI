# PyUI
package designed to mimic the behavior of UI elements in Andoid Studio, but in python
me and a friend (@Lolalization) created this package together, during a 48h hackathon we did together for fun, inorder to help creating the UI for the login page a of an Achtung game we developed

The Achtung repo can be found [here](https://github.com/Lolization/MAchtung)
